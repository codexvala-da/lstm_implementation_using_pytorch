# LSTM implementation using Pytorch
# Amazon Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

This repository contains an implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model using PyTorch for predicting Amazon stock prices based on the last 7 trading sessions.

## Features
- Implementation of an LSTM model in PyTorch for stock price prediction
- Data preprocessing using historical Amazon stock price data
- Training and evaluation of the LSTM model
- Visualization of stock price trends and predictions

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy pandas
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder>
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook LSTM_USING_PYTORCH.ipynb
```

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## File Structure
- `LSTM_USING_PYTORCH.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the LSTM implementation for Amazon stock price prediction

## Results
The notebook includes visualizations and model evaluation metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of the LSTM model in predicting Amazon stock prices.
